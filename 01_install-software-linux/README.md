# Lab 01: Install Software in a Linux Distribution

> **Platform:** Qwiklabs  
> **Skill Area:** Linux, Security, Network Analysis  
> **Date Completed:** YYYY-MM-DD  
> **Difficulty:** Introductory  

---

## üìù Overview
In this lab, you learned to manage applications on a Debian-based Linux system using the APT package manager.  
The lab focused on installing, uninstalling, and verifying network security applications **Suricata** and **tcpdump**.  
This experience is essential for security analysts managing Linux environments.

---

## üéØ Objectives
- Ensure the APT package manager is installed.  
- Install the Suricata network analysis tool.  
- Uninstall Suricata and verify removal.  
- Install tcpdump and verify installation.  
- Reinstall Suricata and confirm both applications are installed.

## üöÄ What I Did

I started the lab by reviewing the **Lab Overview** to understand the objectives and environment:

I first confirmed that the **APT package manager** was installed and ready for use on the system:

Next, I installed **Suricata**, a network intrusion detection tool, using APT with elevated privileges (`sudo`). After installation, I verified that the application was running correctly:

![Verify Suricata](screenshots/04_verify_suricata.png)

I then uninstalled Suricata and confirmed it was removed from the system:

![Verify Uninstall](screenshots/06_error_after_uninstall.png)

After that, I installed **tcpdump**, a command-line network traffic analyzer, and confirmed it appeared in the list of installed applications:

![Tcpdump Installed](screenshots/08_list_tcpdump.png)

Finally, I reinstalled Suricata and checked that both Suricata and tcpdump were installed and ready for use:
